# IBM Granite Model Integration with Java

This project demonstrates how to integrate and invoke **IBM Watsonx.ai Granite Foundation Models** using a **Java HTTP client**.  
It uses a combination of autogenerated code (from IBM Cloud) and manual modifications to call a deployed Granite model for AI-driven responses.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- **Language:** Java
- **Model Used:** IBM Granite (`granite-13b-chat-v2`) — deployed via Watsonx.ai
- **Goal:** Authenticate with IBM Cloud, send a prompt to the model, and print the response
- **Use Case Example:** AI assistant that generates natural language responses based on input prompts

---

## 🧱 Technologies Used

- IBM Cloud IAM for token-based authentication
- IBM Watsonx.ai foundation model deployment
- Java `HttpURLConnection` for HTTP requests
- JSON parsing via string operations (minimal dependencies)

## 📦 Setup Instructions

### 🔐 Prerequisites

1. **IBM Cloud Account** with access to Watsonx.ai
2. A **Granite model deployment** with a known Deployment ID
3. Your **IBM Cloud API Key**

---

### 🔧 Configuration

In `WatsonGraniteClient.java`, replace the placeholders:

```java
String API_KEY = "<YOUR_IBM_CLOUD_API_KEY>";
String scoringUrl = "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com/ml/v4/deployments/<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID>/predictions?version=2021-05-01";
